A real-time computer vision system designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask. This project involves a comparative analysis of multiple Deep Learning architectures—from custom CNNs to Hybrid SVM classifiers—trained on high-performance GPUs to identify the optimal solution for edge deployment.

##  Project Overview

In response to global health safety requirements, this system automates compliance monitoring. The goal was to build a binary classifier (`With Mask` vs `Without Mask`) that achieves high accuracy while remaining lightweight enough for real-time video processing.

We conducted a rigorous study of **five different model architectures** to benchmark performance, training time, and inference speed.

##  Dataset

The model was trained using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle.

* **Source:** [Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection) 
* **Preprocessing:**
    * **Resizing:** All images standardized to 224x224 pixels.
    * **Normalization:** Pixel intensity scaled to the range [-1, 1].
    * **Augmentation:** Applied rotation, zoom, shear, and horizontal flips to increase dataset diversity and prevent overfitting.

##  Model Architectures Tested

To find the best approach, we implemented and evaluated the following architectures:

### 1. Custom CNN (`custom_cnn`)
A standard Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch. This served as our **baseline model** to understand the minimum complexity required to solve the problem.

### 2. VGG-like CNN (`vgg_like_cnn`)
A deeper network architecture inspired by VGG16, utilizing stacked convolution blocks with small receptive fields. We tested this to see if increasing network depth would significantly capture more complex facial features compared to the Custom CNN.

### 3. Transfer Learning (`transfer_learning`)
We utilized **MobileNetV2** pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. By freezing the base layers and fine-tuning the head, we leveraged valid feature extractors learned from millions of images.
* *Result:* This model provided the best balance of speed and accuracy.

### 4. CNN Feature Extractor (`cnn_feature_extractor`)
Instead of using the CNN for classification directly, we removed the fully connected (Dense) layers and used the convolutional base solely to generating high-dimensional feature vectors from the input images.

### 5. SVM Classifier (`svm_classifier`)
A **Hybrid Approach**. We fed the feature vectors generated by the *CNN Feature Extractor* into a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. This tested whether a classical margin-based classifier could outperform the standard Softmax output layer of a Neural Network.

##  Training on Kaggle GPU

Training deep learning models from scratch requires significant computational resources. We leveraged **Kaggle Kernels** to accelerate the training process.

* **Hardware:** NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU (16GB VRAM)
* **Impact:**
    * Drastically reduced training time per epoch.
    * Allowed for larger batch sizes (e.g., 32/64) for stable gradient descent.
    * Enabled rapid experimentation across all 5 architectures.

##  Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
* **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib
